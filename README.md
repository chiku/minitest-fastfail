# MiniTest FastFail

Run minitests in dot-format. However if tests fail show full scope, description and the relevant stack-trace.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'minitest-fastfail'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install minitest-fastfail

## Usage

Include the gem in your project

## Contributing

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, but do not mess with the VERSION. If you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump the version in a commit by itself in another branch so I can ignore it when I pull.
* Send me a pull request.
